Jessica Paoli is an interdisciplinary designer, illustrator, and artist who keeps compassion and cuteness at the forefront of her practice. She develops on- and offline experiences for brands like IGN, Cards Against Humanity, and Mozilla while helping small, independent companies hone their visual identity.

You can find her everywhere url as skullface and irl at her home office & studio in the Midwest. When not designing, Jessica is hanging with her husband and cats, learning to skateboard without breaking any bones, drawing, painting, lettering, reading, and video gaming. On occasion, you can catch her livestreaming exactly that.
