## Introduction

I joined a high-performing team of 9 designers and UI engineers as manager. My first goal was to get to know how they operated individually to get a sense for how the team operated as a whole. I created this exercise to help me get to know each team member on a personal level to inform how I could best support them.

## When to use this exercise

A couple friends asked to use it with their teams, so it works at any point you want to dig into personal working styles, values, and motivations.

## How to use this exercise

1. Introduce the template in a 1:1
2. Give them a week to fill it out on their own time. Encourage them to do what feels most natural to them: speed through with their instincts or take time to deeply think through the answers.
3. Go over their answers together in your next 1:1
4. Ask clarifying questions. Make sure you're not misinterpreting their responses.
5. Share your own answers to the exercise in a linked document so they can read it on their own time if they wish. Mutual vulnerability builds trust!
6. Ask them if they found the exercise valuable and if they have any feedback to improve it (or if they'd like to see more or fewer exercises like this in the future).
