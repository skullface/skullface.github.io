          SKULLFACE is a design leader who defines and elevates Brand and
          Marketing experiences for technology companies. She works as a design
          engineer, visual designer, art director, front-end developer, and
          brand strategist. She likes kerning pairs as much as parallelism as
          much as semantic markup as much as halftones. Through people
          management and design operations, mentorship as an experienced IC, or
          taking on a consulting project, Skully helps lead design and
          engineering teams toward business success and collaborative creative
          health.

          mixes digital illustration with block printing and risography to
          mirror her whimsical and radical interior world. She leaves a trail of
          glitter in her wake at her home studio and <a
