        <title>4 hiccups that are hurting your personal brand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know the term “personal brand” gets some major eye-rolls, but… If you’re freelancing under your own name, your audience’s connection to you correlates your bills getting paid. Branding is imperative when you are the face of your practice — and your practice is your business. Designers who freelance (or monetize a side project) have a personal brand, whether they accept it or not. For some, this comes naturally by just using the Internet. Lettering artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://jenmussari.com/&quot;&gt;Jen Mussari&lt;/a&gt; explained in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingfile.co/episodes/3.html&quot;&gt;Working File episode&lt;/a&gt;, “I haven’t had to focus on self-promotion in years because I’ve never had a problem expressing myself on the Internet.” Not everyone has the privilege to connect with their audience on their own terms by being their authentic selves. Sometimes we need a little more strategy. As good designers, we know a brand identity project without a story is just a few vectors and jpgs. It’s our job to educate our clients on the importance of strategy to set up them up for success. Letting that process slip by in your own business is easy when you’re on the grind, busy with projects day in and day out. While you share your work and promote your practice, be sure you aren’t making these missteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-dont-create-for-yourself-instead-of-your-audience&quot;&gt;1. Don’t create for yourself instead of your audience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to business, even when you are your brand, your message has to resonate with your audience. Think of your favourite artists who developed their brand by creating for themselves. Their work is so popular because their efforts &lt;em&gt;resonate with their audience&lt;/em&gt;. Creating art for a personal practice is not the same as designing to solve a problem for specific users. Your own personal branding should solve a problem for a specific audience as well. Your brand identity should reflect who you are. What will set you apart from others is your audience seeing themselves in your brand’s messaging. Tell your prospective clients the problems you’ll solve for them rather than telling them you design stuff. “&lt;em&gt;Your small business is unique. I help your e-commerce shop get the conversions you deserve.&lt;/em&gt;” helps your audience figure out what they need and what you do. “&lt;em&gt;I am a freelance web designer&lt;/em&gt;” is about you, not them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-dont-try-to-please-everyone-at-once&quot;&gt;2. Don’t try to please everyone at once&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the example headlines above. Apart from the client-focused copy, the other key differentiator is the specific niche. You could get even more specific by replacing “e-commerce shop” with “Shopify store.” There isn’t a problem with being a design generalist, but there’s something to be said about being a master of one trade, at least for your business. While I’m not advocating for TED Talks as the end all be all of expertise, developer and entrepreneur &lt;a href=&quot;https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/the-fear-of-niching/&quot;&gt;Brennan Dunn&lt;/a&gt; makes a fair point when he asks, “Who gives the most interesting TED talks? Generalists, or specialists? &lt;em&gt;In fact, who gives any kind of TED talk?&lt;/em&gt;” Even if you don’t think finding a niche is your thing, keep your intended audience in mind. You don’t want to design for everyone in the whole world. Maybe your values drive which projects you’ll accept or turn down. Keeping your brand messages focused will draw in the audience you want to attract (and keep out everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-dont-create-one-offs-for-every-touchpoint&quot;&gt;3. Don’t create one-offs for every touchpoint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something we know for our client work, but can sometimes slip up for ourselves. Consistency is key in branding. I’m not saying your social media accounts have to have a rigid and soulless strategy; the “personal” in “personal brand” is what’s most important! But veering off course in your promotional touchpoints can water down your message and confuse your audience. How can you expect a prospective client to recognize you if your tone changes in each post, profile pic, or email? How can you stand out from the competition if each one of your touchpoints lacks a consistent voice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-dont-assume-design-is-everything&quot;&gt;4. Don’t assume design is everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tell our clients having a gorgeous logo by itself isn’t going to make them a million dollars. We steer them in the right direction when they think they’ll have Nike’s success by having an iconic logo mark. We also know to be taken seriously in a market, you have to have an appropriate identity. A good designer will ask the right questions to give the client the right design… only if the client has the right answers to those questions. You have to play both sides of that conversation when branding yourself. Pretty artifacts in your portfolio won’t do it all for you. “Design thinking” is a cute buzzword in the corporate world over the past few years. People want to replicate the success of “design-first” tech companies like Airbnb, whose cofounders are designers. But &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; isn’t what makes those “design thinking” companies money. The only brand that make money from Photoshop is Adobe. AirBnB found their fame and profit after years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+Ht3pQnGd4&quot;&gt;struggling and pivoting&lt;/a&gt;. Their business model was stumbled upon by accident, not by design. (And they’re not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/travel/airbnb-discrimination-lawsuit.html&quot;&gt;perfect company&lt;/a&gt;, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, your work will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hanging br&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip;If you have case studies to explain it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hanging br&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip;And if it resonates with your audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;hanging br&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip;And if your marketing efforts get people looking at it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What jobs can I get as a designer?</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;If you’re studying Design in school, confused about the ever-changing Job Title landscape, or are looking to specialize in something a little different, I’ve compiled a list of the different roles tech, media, and advertising companies are looking for. This isn’t guaranteed to be up-to-date in a month, but at least the Rockstars and Ninjas of years’ past are dying out. &lt;em&gt;Designer&lt;/em&gt; as a title doesn’t tell someone much about the type of work you do everyday, aside from loosely relating to “design.” Right now as a Designer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://voxmedia.com&quot;&gt;Vox Media&lt;/a&gt;, I create design systems for marketing materials and branded experiences. As a Designer at a digital marketing agency, I designed UI elements for high-performing B2B e-commerce properties. Both roles held the title of Designer, but had differing responsibilities and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;hanging&quot;&gt;&amp;#42; &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: If it was not clear, this article discusses what is commonly known as graphic, print, branding, web, app, and digital product design. I will not be discussing architecture, interior, floral, game, industrial, or fashion design. Should I have incorrectly described a role here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/home?status=@skullface%20Hi%20Skullface!%20&quot;&gt;tell me nicely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;media align-none&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:3000/media/posts/2017/jessicapaoli-dot-com_designer-jobs_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-work-on-digital-properties-and-products-you-can-be-a&quot;&gt;When you work on digital properties and products, you can be a…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-designer-web-designer-ui-designer&quot;&gt;Visual Designer (Web Designer, UI Designer)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your expertise is creating the look &amp;amp; feel of websites and apps. That doesn’t mean you don’t care about the other parts, but your focus is the visual layer and its polish. You convey specific messages and elevate the product using typography, space, layout, color, and imagery. You work hand-in-hand with the UX Designer and collaborate with the Front End Designer/Developer. You might work with code to help realize your ideas, but you definitely have an understanding of the way the web works. You might create: sketches, static mockups, interactive mockups, style tiles/element collages, moodboards, marketing materials&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-designer-ux-designer&quot;&gt;User Experience Designer (UX Designer)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are responsible for the underlying design strategy and architecture of information. (In the past, the role itself was called Information Architecture, or IA). You determine how the user will interact with your product or property. You advocate for the user, keeping the best interests of them and the business in mind. You write documentation to explain and support your decisions. You often do the role of a User Researcher, especially in a lean team. You might create: wireframes, prototypes, personas, site maps, heuristic analyses, user journeys or storyboards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-researcher&quot;&gt;User Researcher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You conduct field research, focus groups, interviews, tests, and surveys to obtain qualitative &amp;amp; quantitative data on users and the industry landscape. You identify patterns and trends in user behavior through research and analytics. This role aligns with psychology and anthropology. You question and validate design and product assumptions. You turn your findings into recommendations to inform the work of the Design, Product Management, Executive, and Engineering teams. You might create: usability reports, analytics reports, user journeys &amp;amp; user maps, affinity groupings, content audits and inventories, competitive analysis reports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-designer-visual--user-experience--interaction&quot;&gt;Product Designer (Visual + User Experience + Interaction)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do a variety of all of the above roles, and sometimes the work of a Front End Designer or Front End Engineer. Your T-shaped expertise is highly-sought after in tech companies. (Not to be confused with a designer of physical products, or an industrial designer.) You might create: everything above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;front-end-designer-ui-developer&quot;&gt;Front End Designer (UI Developer)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You perform the role of a Visual Designer and User Experience Designer, working in HTML, CSS, and JS. You work with Visual Designer, UX Designers, User Researchers, and Front End Engineers to create presentation-layer interfaces and interactions. You design, build, deploy, maintain, and optimize one-off projects and reusable libraries and systems. You research and implement the latest in optimization, browser compatibility, usability, accessibility, web standards, and user-centered design. You might create: interactive prototypes, style guides &amp;amp; pattern libraries, version-controlled code, media assets &amp;amp; resources, decisions documentation, technical requirements &amp;amp; functional specifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;front-end-developer-front-end-engineer&quot;&gt;Front End Developer (Front End Engineer)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You craft the front-end code of a product, working alongside Designers, Developers, and Engineers. This role closer aligns to Software &amp;amp; Engineering rather than Design. You work in HTML, CSS, and JS, with a major emphasis on modern Javascript best practices. You integrate the markup and JS with other languages in the product’s stack. Increasingly, this role is expected to have client-side and server-side full-stack familiarity. You might create: interactive prototypes, style guides &amp;amp; pattern libraries, version-controlled code, decisions documentation, technical requirements &amp;amp; functional specifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-work-on-the-visual-expressions-of-brands-and-ideas-you-can-be-a&quot;&gt;When you work on the visual expressions of brands and ideas, you can be a…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;graphic-designer-visual-designer&quot;&gt;Graphic Designer (Visual Designer)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your role is the “Visual Designer” of branding and marketing (as opposed to the design of digital properties and products). A strong understanding of type, color, composition, layout, and production is key because your work spans so many touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe you’re a book cover designer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you specialize in laying out the typography systems inside those books&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you design the charts and graphics inside the book&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you create the materials to advertise the book’s launch, from online banner ads to billboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you design the exhibition space and accompanying guide for the book’s launch party&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you craft the brand identity system for the book publisher and their parent company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or you do literally all of that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example specialties: Packaging, experiential (exhibits and/or environments), signage, information, surface (illustrated repeating patterns, often for textiles) branding, advertising, marketing, publications, books Example niches for a generalist: Restaurants &amp;amp; food, makeup &amp;amp; beauty, board games, law, PR, healthcare, small business entrepreneurs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;letterer&quot;&gt;Letterer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;draw&lt;/em&gt; letters. You might not have great handwriting because you draw letters! Your work is based on draftsmanship. You might create: anything a Graphic Designer does, featuring custom lettering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calligrapher&quot;&gt;Calligrapher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; letters. This is a specific, learned practice + skill, separate from lettering. You might create: anything a graphic designer does, featuring custom calligraphy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-designer&quot;&gt;Type Designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You design typefaces and type families. You draw and program letters for the express purpose of becoming a downloadable font. You research and review new technical typographic developments on the web to implement in your designs. You might create: fonts to be purchased for public consumption, custom fonts commissioned by companies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;illustrator&quot;&gt;Illustrator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create commercial artwork for companies. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; also be a comic book artist, storyboard artist, or conceptual visual development artist. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; also be a Graphic Designer. Sometimes the two overlap, but just because an Illustrator is amazing at creating illustrations does not mean they are a skilled Graphic Designer, and vice versa. You might create: editorial illustrations, advertising and marketing illustrations, icon systems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motion-graphics-designer&quot;&gt;Motion Graphics Designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work with the elements of Graphic Design (color, composition, layout, typography) with the addition of &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt;. You might also be an animator. The work of an animator is more closely tied to illustration such that it focuses on the moving expression of a narrative. (When watching a cartoon on “Cartoon Network”, the television program is an animation and the network title screens before and after the show are motion graphics.) You might also be a visual effects artist. Visual effects composited on top of live action video are their own distinct speciality. You might create: animated mockups, marketing videos, intro &amp;amp; outro bumpers, lower-thirds, film title sequences, television graphics (broadcast design)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hierarchy&quot;&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intern-to-junior-to-middleweight-to-senior-to-staff-or-manager-to-director-to-officer&quot;&gt;Intern to Junior to Middleweight to Senior to Staff or Manager to Director to Officer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the the first few years of a Designer’s career are focused on production and implementation as you learn the landscape. As you grow, you gain more opportunities to conceptualize and collaborate on ideation and execution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/junior-designers-vs-senior-designers-fbe483d3b51e#.2x9l83jjm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;bridging the gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Promotions as a designer don’t mean your UIs get prettier every year or you’re better at kerning. Sharing work early and often, practicing sharp communication skills to explain and justify decisions, using data to inform those decisions, and encouraging others as an example are some of what count more than taste. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8HHMXe2LIj4V6SfnxXm-3FCDkZP0U7lLt9dvtjNrHk/edit#heading=h.kthodoi1iyku&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed Design&lt;/a&gt; has open-sourced an incredible resource to see the responsibilities of the different roles inside the Product Design department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason why the parents of today’s high schoolers tell their kids to go into tech. There’s an abundance of design work to be done across the world, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://navahq.com/&quot;&gt;improving the state of the nation&lt;/a&gt; to helping some rich asshole get richer (and lots of in-betweens). As technology changes, as the programs and languages we use come in and out of fashion, and as we recognize the rights of others &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility&quot;&gt;too long spent ignored&lt;/a&gt;, the need for good work done by good people endures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning your new year (+ a quarterly calendar printable)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll be blunt here: I got a lot of shit done &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/year-in-review-2016/&quot; title=&quot;Year in review: 2016&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Planning and preparedness is part of my nature &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it helps me cope with my anxiety. (I’m a wannabe-ENTP fake-Ravenclaw pseudo-Virgo, what can I say?) There are a thousand ways to plan and execute, but I’m sharing my method (with a bonus calendar!) here with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;media align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2017/jessicapaoli-dot-com_quarterly-calendar-printable_2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-to-do-by-2018-who-do-you-want-to-be&quot;&gt;What do you want to do by 2018? Who do you want to be?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubpages.com/holidays/End-of-the-Year-Reflections-Process-and-Survey-Questions-to-End-the-Year-Mindfully&quot;&gt;reflect on the past 12 months&lt;/a&gt;. Then consider what you want to achieve this year. Is there a single theme that ties those achievements together? Can you distill the feelings you’d get from those achievements into one word? Make that your &lt;strong&gt;word of the year&lt;/strong&gt; to guide you through your goals, actions, and mindset. (For reference, my word of 2016 was &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/word-of-2016-light/&quot;&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and my word of 2017 is &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/year-in-review-2016/&quot;&gt;reach&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-will-you-get-there&quot;&gt;How will you get there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;think-about-the-year-in-quarterly-sprints&quot;&gt;Think about the year in quarterly sprints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarters aren’t just for board meetings or estimated taxes. They’re a great way to break down an entire year into more manageable chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-four-big-picture-goals&quot;&gt;Create four big-picture goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take those achievements you brainstormed earlier when determining your word of the year. What are &lt;em&gt;four big things&lt;/em&gt; you want to accomplish before 2018? These can relate to your health, family, full-time job, income, passions and hobbies, independent businesses, client list, side projects, art practice, school, or personal development… It all works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;break-down-each-big-picture-goal-into-3-milestones&quot;&gt;Break down each big-picture goal into 3 milestones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each goal from the previous step now gets sliced and diced into three measurable, attainable milestones. If your guiding word of the year is “prosperity” and one of your big-picture goals is to land a $30k project, your three your milestones for that goal could be (1) consolidate your client onboarding process into one sleek system, (2) revamp your portfolio with up to date case studies &amp;amp; testimonials, (3) strategize and automate your social media presence to entice your dream clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-happen-on-schedule&quot;&gt;Make it happen, on schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll spend 1 month (4 weeks) reaching &lt;em&gt;each milestone&lt;/em&gt;. When you complete all three milestones, &lt;em&gt;you’ll have ended a quarter by reaching one of your goals!&lt;/em&gt; Repeat with your other three goals and you’re exactly where you want to be at the end of the year. If you want the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dominican.edu/academics/ahss/undergraduate-programs/psych/faculty/assets-gail-matthews/researchsummary2.pdf&quot;&gt;greatest chance of success&lt;/a&gt;: write down your goals, share them with a friend, and give that friend regular updates on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-balance-between-momentum-and-forgiveness&quot;&gt;The balance between momentum and forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know everything sounds amazing right now, but let’s be real. We’re going to slide off course. We’ll slip up. Maybe July will be a total derailing suckfest and you’ll have to work twice as hard in August, or write off that one milestone entirely for now. Be kind to yourself. Remain kind to yourself. &lt;em&gt;Give yourself some grace and some wiggle room.&lt;/em&gt; Designer &amp;amp; goal-getter &lt;a href=&quot;http://melanie-richards.com/blog/2016-review/&quot;&gt;Melanie Richards&lt;/a&gt; realized she needed different approaches for her yearly goals: some goals are better served as new habits and some can be downgraded to general suggestions. You can’t be 100% productive 100% of the time. There’s way more to life than unhealthy hustle. Wherever you are, you’ll be on the right track if you keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hop-to-it&quot;&gt;Hop to it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting caught up in goal-setting minutiae is less effective than daydreaming. I’m sharing a loosely-structured printable to help you guide through your goals! It’s a Monday-start no-gap calendar, separated by quarter on letter-sized paper. Let me know if it’s helpful for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content-upgrade&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-upgrade_image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2017/jessicapaoli-dot-com_quarterly-calendar-printable_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;form action=&quot;https://www.getdrip.com/forms/56427556/submissions&quot; class=&quot;content-upgrade_form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;download&quot; data-drip-embedded-form=&quot;56427556&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 data-drip-attribute=&quot;headline&quot;&gt;Plan your year with the 2017 no-gap quarterly calendar printable.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;form-fields&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;form-field&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;fields[first_name]&quot; placeholder=&quot;First name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;form-field&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;fields[email]&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email address (required)&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Let’s set some goals &amp;gt;&quot; data-drip-attribute=&quot;sign-up-button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodreads.com/jsca&quot;&gt;11 books&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; hella comics. Listened to too many podcasts. Watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://letterboxd.com/jsca&quot;&gt;23 films&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://trakt.tv/users/skullface&quot;&gt;919+ episodes of television&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;january&quot;&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Took my first solo trip anywhere outside the 10-mile radius of my hometown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Began a full-time remote position on the Design team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://voxmedia.com&quot;&gt;Vox Media&lt;/a&gt; — you probably know us from brands like &lt;a href=&quot;http://vox.com&quot;&gt;Vox.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://theverge.com&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://polygon.com&quot;&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shipped cute stickers to my Patreon backers ♥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;february&quot;&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent a week meeting coworkers in Washington, DC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learned what it’s like to go to sleep on a Sunday night excited for work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostlustsupply.com&quot;&gt;Lost Lust Supply&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostlustsupply.com/shop/false-luck-pin&quot;&gt;my False Luck pin&lt;/a&gt; (its limited first run sold out within weeks!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got my last haircut of the year as I push out of my comfort zone to grow out my ‘do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shipped &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skullface/status/708738017226313728&quot;&gt;Valentine’s Day cards&lt;/a&gt; to my Patreon backers ♥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;march&quot;&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moved out of my hometown to a new place with double the square footage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought our first real pieces of furniture, starting with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://joybird.com/sofas/hughes-sofa/&quot;&gt;couch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDtdX87zgsN/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; — my first time traveling west of Chicago. Met some beautiful Internet friends, including an afternoon in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDtve7_zgpc/&quot;&gt;Japantown&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paladique&quot;&gt;Jasmine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;april&quot;&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Shipped cute temporary tattoos to my Patreon backers ♥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;may&quot;&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Met up with super smart coworkers to determine &lt;a href=&quot;http://accessibility.voxmedia.com&quot;&gt;accessibility guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for our practices within the company and our efforts across the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saw my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/2727457-Save-The-Date-email-design&quot;&gt;experiential art direction&lt;/a&gt; come to life &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/nbcuniversal-vox-advertising-1201744538/&quot;&gt;at NewFronts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skullface/status/782604103029493760&quot;&gt;tshirt on Cotton Bureau.&lt;/a&gt; It had enough interested to get printed but didn’t receive enough orders for me to make any cash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initiated a monthly sleepover tradition with my sister now that I live a little further from her ♥&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed an animated &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/2743398-Mixed-Feelings&quot;&gt;logo header&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://alisharamos.com/&quot;&gt;Alisha Ramos&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/mixedfeelings&quot;&gt;mixed race identity newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shipped cute stickers to my Patreon backers ♥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;june&quot;&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Cavaliers won the NBA Championship (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flew to LA (second time in California ever! this year!) to oversee an event I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHdDhxggtfA/&quot;&gt;art directed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eater.com/2016/6/28/12033588/young-guns-2016-winners&quot;&gt;Eater Young Guns&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;amp; yes, the food was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turned 24 on my birthday, ayyyy 😎&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;july&quot;&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent a week in Chicago, hacking with the Vox Media &lt;a href=&quot;http://product.voxmedia.com&quot;&gt;Product Team&lt;/a&gt; (the dream team of &lt;a href=&quot;http://danibalenson.com&quot;&gt;Dani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://katiekovalc.in&quot;&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;, in particular!) in the daytime, seeing old friends at tiki bars and burger bars in the evenings ♥&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Featured in Dribbble’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/stories/2016/07/06/timeout-jessica-paoli&quot;&gt;Timeout interview&lt;/a&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paused my Patreon campaign to focus on getting the real False Luck store ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;august&quot;&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made an order for 200 enamel pins for False Luck’s hard launch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Became &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRCOldQ3l8&quot;&gt;re-obsessed with k-pop&lt;/a&gt; after a ~five year break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;september&quot;&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKBw3fJgMo2/&quot;&gt;Got married&lt;/a&gt;! ♥♥♥ We had our parents in the mayor’s office at city hall &amp;amp; then we got our fav drive-in fast food burgers, visited our skate shop and local comic book store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Realigned jessicapaoli.com on Jekyll with a streamlined portfolio design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traveled to NYC for the first time — explored the Lower Manhattan, ate bagels and Korean barbecue, hung out with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/horsesica&quot;&gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ohhoe&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; ♥&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depression hits, even after all this greatness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;october&quot;&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took an intermediate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BLCT7IYjRuv/&quot;&gt;calligraphy workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saw Kanye West at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skullface/status/782604103029493760&quot;&gt;the Saint Pablo tour&lt;/a&gt; — I’ve been waiting to see him live for literally half of my life (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This hikikomori couple had friends over for the first time, v adult, board games and pizza and chicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And then we launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://grawlix.co&quot;&gt;Grawlix&lt;/a&gt;, our design consultancy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent a night in DC to enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://product.voxmedia.com/2016/11/8/13554770/designing-pixel-punch-3-0&quot;&gt;Pixel Punch&lt;/a&gt;, a Vox Media volunteer-run event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Played my first tabletop RPG session as a lawful good teen girl halfling mage with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JAH2488&quot;&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt; DMing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depression stays and it hurts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;november&quot;&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A painful political apocalypse doth rise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked on a logotype for &lt;a href=&quot;http://rachelnabors.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Nabors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took a few online courses focused on woman entrepreneurs: specialized in marketing and business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did a full relaunch of JessicaPaoli.com (hi!!!) since I’m taking freelance work with Grawlix, pivoting to a new business model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The third event I art directed for the year, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ny.eater.com/2016/11/17/13663156/eater-awards-2016-event&quot;&gt;The 2016 Eater Awards&lt;/a&gt;, was a smash hit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exacerbated by current events, depression &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hurts this month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;december&quot;&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BN2En1QjWOQ/&quot;&gt;Showcased a piece&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://moonprismpower.net&quot;&gt;Moon Prism Power&lt;/a&gt;, a Sailor Moon art show by women &amp;amp; nonbinary artists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did a rad project with Cards Against Humanity’s sister company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackbox.cool&quot;&gt;Blackbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finalized that pin order from August; remember that depression thing I told you about? Yeah. Had to take some things slower. Everything’s looking up &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the pins ship at the end of the month!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking forward to start hitting my 2017 Q1 goals in business, health, and home ♥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;word-of-the-year&quot;&gt;Word of the year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;a href=&quot;http://jessicapaoli.com/2016/year-in-review-2015/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, I focused on the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://jessicapaoli.com/2016/word-of-2016-light/&quot;&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; to drive my goals, actions, and mindset. It worked for everything (except the way I packed for trips)! Some big changes in circumstance helped me approach the days with a &lt;em&gt;lighter&lt;/em&gt; sense of self as I worked hard to make it happen. In 2017, my guiding word is &lt;strong&gt;reach&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m not shooting for &lt;em&gt;the stars&lt;/em&gt;, I’m aiming toward Andromeda. I will stretch and flex past the self-imposed and societally-mandated boundaries I created and maintained out of fear. My horizons will grow, closing in on what feels like far-off distances. I will extend what I believe I’m capable of — without overextending myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Representation: 33 amazing nonbinary &amp;amp; women of color illustrators</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;hanging&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Representation” is a series highlighting talented individuals from underrepresented groups in art, design, tech, and business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I penned this post into my editorial calendar a few weeks ago when a Design Director friend solicited recommendations for female illustrators. When I realized the first few talented, freelancers who came to my mind were &lt;em&gt;not white men&lt;/em&gt;, I made sure the rest of my recommendations were also GNC/nonbinary people and women of color. I’m sharing that list &amp;amp; more with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is, of course, non-exhaustive! I’ve included a few of my absolute favorite artists and friends with varying styles, skills, and specialties. To discover more badass talent on your own, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenwhodraw.com&quot;&gt;Women Who Draw&lt;/a&gt; — a brand new directory of woman illustrators, artists, and cartoonists available for work — and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cartoonistsofcolor.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cartoonists of Color Database &lt;/a&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://queercartoonists.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Queer Cartoonists Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; If you appear on this list and would like to be removed for any reason, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/skullface&quot;&gt;@ me&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Organize your job hunt &amp;amp; avoid overwhelm with Trello</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for your next opportunity for a new job, there are a thousand things to worry about at any given moment. The last thing you want to do during that mega-stressful period is waste time and accidentally lose someone’s contact info. Here’s my system to stay on top of your options &amp;amp; communications to avoid getting overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board&quot;&gt;kanban board&lt;/a&gt; to organize ideas. You can do this &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/jsca/recommend&quot;&gt;for free with Trello&lt;/a&gt; or by using post-it notes on a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I went through a major job search, I used a spreadsheet to keep track of the process. It worked well for me, but when my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mina.codes&quot;&gt;Mina&lt;/a&gt; suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/jsca/recommend&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, I knew that was the ultimate option. I use this type of system to document leads &amp;amp; existing clients in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/G7i9fEgj/sales-pipeline&quot;&gt;Sales Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;http://trelloforbusiness.com&quot;&gt;Trello for Business&lt;/a&gt;. So, why not apply it here? If you’re in school, this method works for internships, grants &amp;amp; scholarships, and post-grad programs, too! Heck, you can even use it to organize your dating life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/npq3V86Z/job-hunt-example-board&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_trello-job-hunt_board.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lanes-as-status-checks&quot;&gt;Lanes as status checks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our information is organized by where you are in the interview process with each company. Setting up calls and in-person interviews? Congrats, that’s the “&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing with (!!!)&lt;/strong&gt;” lane! I used the other statuses of “Waiting on”, “Follow up with”, “Rejected”, “Offers” (YES!), and “Ideas” in my list, but you might want to add or remove steps as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cardis-life&quot;&gt;Card is life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;align-left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_trello-job-hunt_rolodexin.png&quot; class=&quot;widdo-smol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rolodexing&quot;&gt;Rolodexing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company is its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/c/0ONyqkw0/14-amazon-games-studio&quot;&gt;card&lt;/a&gt;. In standard Trello fashion, we’re updating the card when something new arises and moving the card to its appropriate lane throughout the process. All the data in the example cards is faked, naturally, but I wanted to use examples that feel closer to real life than “Acme Corp.” &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; some of the listing links in the cards go to real job openings, so apply away! For easy access of information like an old school little black book, I’ve a templatized description to each card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_trello-job-hunt_progress.png&quot; class=&quot;widdo-smol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-indicator&quot;&gt;Progress indicator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for a better picture of where I’m at with each company, there is a &lt;strong&gt;Progress&lt;/strong&gt; checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every position will have that same checklist, of course, but the progress gives you a quick perspective of how far you’ve gotten with one company over another when they’re both in the “Interviewing with” lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;align-left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_trello-job-hunt_labels.png&quot; class=&quot;widdo-smol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criteria-sorting&quot;&gt;Criteria sorting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further organization, I’ve &lt;strong&gt;labelled&lt;/strong&gt; each card with the company’s location. If you’re looking for a local job in NYC, my state labels could be your Brooklyn neighborhoods. Since a card can have multiple labels, you could make your labels important perks (401k match, health/fitness stipend, public transit covered) for an at-a-glance view of what each organization offers or lacks. Remember You can sort all your cards by label! If you need to see every place you’ve talked to that fits a certain criteria, do it via labelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_trello-job-hunt_history.png&quot; class=&quot;widdo-smol&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diary-entries&quot;&gt;Diary entries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since activity on cards is timestamped on Trello, I choose to use &lt;strong&gt;comments&lt;/strong&gt; as a way to track events. These are notes to yourself. If something went horribly, you can vent here and reflect back on it later on. Scheduled a Google Hangout via email? After you’ve added it to your calendar, you can note it quickly in a comment and have a concise place to see how the whole process has progressed. Speaking of calendars… since you can attach a specific date to a card, you can even put your next interview/meeting/call as the card’s due date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;go-get-em&quot;&gt;Go get ‘em!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/npq3V86Z/job-hunt-example-board&quot;&gt;peep the example board here&lt;/a&gt; and make a copy of it for yourself (open the Sidebar Menu, click “More”, then “Copy Board”) to help you maintain an organized system for your next job search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want your own ridiculous dollar bill background, you need Trello Gold. It’s $5 a month, but I think it’s worth it for that visualization alone. If you don’t even have a Trello account, make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/jsca/recommend&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; right meow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear if this system to organize your job search with Trello helps you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&amp;amp;text=@skullface+I+read+your+post+on+organizing+with+Trello+and&quot;&gt;over on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — let me know when you land that dream gig!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>35+ of my favorite websites for design inspiration</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_inspiration-websites-banner.jpg&quot; class=&quot;widdo-medium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where do you get your inspiration from?” is a tricky question. Relying too much on the trends in your industry or keeping your head too far into what others are doing can put you in a hole where you’re making aesthetic design decisions based on other people’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there’s Dribbble and Behance, but the popular posts on those communities are almost guaranteed to be an insular circle jerk based on likes. If you keep track of the right accounts, Tumblr and Pinterest can be inspirational goldmines. To keep myself from getting distracted by NSFW gifs or home decor DIY projects, though, I like to stick with a few select curated blogs and galleries. Here is where I go when I need to pull reference images for a moodboard, keep on top of the best of what’s happening around me, glean insight from others’ processes, and look at pretty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 gorgeous web fonts and their free Google Font alternatives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not all fonts are made equal, especially when it comes to their use for the web. Designers with clients on a budget (or creativeprenuers looking to save money where they can!) know the monetary cost of well-made web fonts can add up quickly, especially if the license is based on page views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are ten gorgeous and versatile type families made with care from expert type foundries… with a corresponding super similar-feeling Google Font. The “premier” fonts will have more weights, special details, support from the foundries themselves if you ever need, and the guarantee they won’t disappear that Google can’t provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/tablet-gothic/?refby=skullface&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-half&quot; src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_type-specimens_sans_head_tablet-gothic.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tablet Gothic: premium alternative to Archivo Narrow from Google Fonts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-half&quot; src=&quot;/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_type-specimens_sans_head_archivo-narrow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Archivo Narrow: free alternative to Tablet Gothic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
